        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer with a passion for new technology. Skilled at HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, React, Redux, FeathersJS, MySQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, GIT, Less, Npm, Webpack, Mocha, Chai, Travis-CI, Jekyll, Passport,
            Spring, Java, and Android. When it comes to studying I use Pluralsight, books, Stackoverflow, or looking at documentation to figure things out.</p>
        <p>I love all kinds of music but prefer Rap, R&amp;B, Dance, and electro house. Music artists like Skrillex, Usher, and Jayz to name a few. I also love to workout, either going to the gym or the park when I have free time. Aside from those things,
            I love spending time with my family.</p>

        <p>This is a shopping list app that allows for the creation of various lists with their own items. The lists are stored locally, so coming back to the page the user will be able to see their previous list. In the shopping list section, the selected
            item is highlighted. The shopping list items section highlights any list item that is crossed off the list. Deleting items in both list removes it from storage. It uses Html, Css, Jquery, Javascript, and LocalStorage.
