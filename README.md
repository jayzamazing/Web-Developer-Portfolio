#Web Developer Portfolio
This is my portfolio where I will be adding some of my more recent projects along
with a description of who I am. Currently using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and form validation using the jQuery Validation Plugin. Check it out at https://jayzamazing.github.io/Web-Developer-Portfolio.
